# Research-Journal

This journal will contain brief notes related to my ongoing research. It may contain:

 - Plans for the day's work.
 - Summaries of the day's work.
 - Thoughts on ongoing research.
 - Notes from important meetings.
 - Plans for future work.
 - Plans for possible experiments.
 - Plans for future publications.
 - Notes, drafts and outlines related to planned publications.
 - Notes from interesting papers (with doi references).

And similar such things.

It will not contain:

 - Extensive mathematical derivations.
 - Extensive experimental data.
 - Thorough experimental plans.

Journal entries will be dated in a year-month-day format, followed by a brief heading for the day's work. An appropriate title would be:

*2019-06-22-Getting-Married-Today*

Files may be saved in markdown or .txt format.

I hope this is clear to all concerned.
