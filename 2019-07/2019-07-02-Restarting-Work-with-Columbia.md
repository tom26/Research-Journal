## Restarting Work with Columbia Modelling  

## July 2, 2019

After having a lovely break for my wedding and honeymoon, I have to get back to work. The most urgent matter is to make some progress on the modelling for Columbia University, which I will work on today. Some secondary matters which I am aware need my attention are:

 - Matt Biviano's particle-compression work.
 - The 3 unfinished papers from my PhD. I should make some progress on these before the end of the month.
 - The tutoring work I am being paid for by Greg Qiao.

However, we are going to begin with Columbia. They hav easked for a Skype call, and I want to have at least done as much as I feel I reasonably can before that talk.
