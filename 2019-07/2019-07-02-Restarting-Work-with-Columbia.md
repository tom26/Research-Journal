## Restarting Work with Columbia Modelling  

## July 2, 2019

After having a lovely break for my wedding and honeymoon, I have to get back to work. The most urgent matter is to make some progress on the modelling for Columbia University, which I will work on today. Some secondary matters which I am aware need my attention are:

 - Matt Biviano's particle-compression work.
 - The 3 unfinished papers from my PhD. I should make some progress on these before the end of the month.
 - The tutoring work I am being paid for by Greg Qiao.

However, we are going to begin with Columbia. They hav easked for a Skype call, and I want to have at least done as much as I feel I reasonably can before that talk. 

## Can we get away with a diffusion-controlled model for all of the data?

In my thesis, I found that a diffusion-controlled model worked well for one particular data-set sent through by Guanhe. I now need to check that this works for all of the different datasets. To do this, I will begin by plotting the uptake against the square root of the of time, and look for a linear region. We are doing this in Columbia_Data_Analysis_June_2019.jl.
