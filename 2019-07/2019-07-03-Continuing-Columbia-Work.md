We began today by making 5 plots of moles absorbed vs sqrt (t - t_0), and looking for a linear region that extrapolates back to the origin. This is what I did in my thesis, however I don't know if I fully understood *why* this was required at the time. In effect what we are looking for is moving-front behaviour, and the big give-away for this behaviour is that the rate of absorption vs time will decay at *just* the right rate to be linear against the square root of time, provided that the start-time is the backwards-extrapolated time at which the moving front would be colliding with the wall if there were no reaction resistance at all. 

I have been using trial and error to find the linear regions. I am happy with what I have found, but I suspect there may be a more rigorous way of checking for such a region - some clever plot that will show us both the best t0 value, and the slope of the n vs sqrt (t-t_0) line. I'll give this a bit of thought now. 

Yup yup yup. Always trust your instinct. It is *much* more sensible to plot n^2 vs t, as this, in principle, should have a linear region which will give us both C and t_0 from the slope and y-intercept. I'll do this now and report back.
